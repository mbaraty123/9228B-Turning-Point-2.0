\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for global functions. 

Any experienced C or C++ programmer knows the importance of header files. For those who do not, a header file allows multiple files to reference functions in other files without necessarily having to see the code (and therefore causing a multiple definition). To make a function in \char`\"{}opcontrol.\+c\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}auto.\+c\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}main.\+c\char`\"{}, or any other C file visible to the core implementation files, prototype it here.

This file is included by default in the predefined stubs in each V\+EX Cortex P\+R\+OS Project.

\subsubsection{autonomous()}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily void autonomous (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Runs the user autonomous code. This function will be started in its own task with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via the Field Management System or the V\+EX Competition Switch in the autonomous mode. If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the autonomous task will be stopped by the kernel. Re-\/enabling the robot will restart the task, not re-\/start it from where it left off.

Code running in the autonomous task cannot access information from the V\+EX Joystick. However, the autonomous function can be invoked from another task if a V\+EX Competition Switch is not available, and it can access joystick information if called in this way.

The autonomous task may exit, unlike \doxyref{operator\+Control()}{p.}{main_8h_ac71a94af413917f27d108e95c4d6f6a7} which should never exit. If it does so, the robot will await a switch to another mode or disable/enable cycle.

\subsubsection{initialize()}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily void initialize (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Runs user initialization code. This function will be started in its own task with the default priority and stack size once when the robot is starting up. It is possible that the V\+E\+Xnet communication link may not be fully established at this time, so reading from the V\+EX Joystick may fail.

This function should initialize most sensors (gyro, encoders, ultrasonics), L\+C\+Ds, global variables, and I\+M\+Es.

This function must exit relatively promptly, or the \doxyref{operator\+Control()}{p.}{main_8h_ac71a94af413917f27d108e95c4d6f6a7} and \doxyref{autonomous()}{p.}{main_8h_a3c7ca506bbc071fa740de13805b7f376} tasks will not start. An autonomous mode selection menu like the pre\+\_\+auton() in other environments can be implemented in this task if desired.

\subsubsection{initialize\+I\+O()}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily void initialize\+IO (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Runs pre-\/initialization code. This function will be started in kernel mode one time while the V\+EX Cortex is starting up. As the scheduler is still paused, most A\+PI functions will fail.

The purpose of this function is solely to set the default pin modes (\doxyref{pin\+Mode()}{p.}{_a_p_i_8h_a1875409d12eee562555bda94cad7f973}) and port states (\doxyref{digital\+Write()}{p.}{_a_p_i_8h_a23e767e5b47fa61d4e2cc02e6f15c7ab}) of limit switches, push buttons, and solenoids. It can also safely configure a U\+A\+RT port (usart\+Open()) but cannot set up an L\+CD (\doxyref{lcd\+Init()}{p.}{_a_p_i_8h_a43dc11a67b697c0d32315ea5a9af85f9}).

\subsubsection{operator\+Control()}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily void operator\+Control (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Runs the user operator control code. This function will be started in its own task with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via the Field Management System or the V\+EX Competition Switch in the operator control mode. If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the operator control task will be stopped by the kernel. Re-\/enabling the robot will restart the task, not resume it from where it left off.

If no V\+EX Competition Switch or Field Management system is plugged in, the V\+EX Cortex will run the operator control task. Be warned that this will also occur if the V\+EX Cortex is tethered directly to a computer via the U\+SB A to A cable without any V\+EX Joystick attached.

Code running in this task can take almost any action, as the V\+EX Joystick is available and the scheduler is operational. However, proper use of \doxyref{delay()}{p.}{_a_p_i_8h_a1c59207742a1acf45a8957d7f04f9dfe} or \doxyref{task\+Delay\+Until()}{p.}{_a_p_i_8h_ae93bc867b1aa4a12d6536a497f1b6869} is highly recommended to give other tasks (including system tasks such as updating L\+C\+Ds) time to run.

This task should never exit; it should end with some kind of infinite loop, even if empty.
