00019 \textcolor{comment}{ * Runs the user operator control code. This function will be started in its own task with the}

00021 \textcolor{comment}{ * or the VEX Competition Switch in the operator control mode. If the robot is disabled or}

00025 \textcolor{comment}{ * If no VEX Competition Switch or Field Management system is plugged in, the VEX Cortex will}
00026 \textcolor{comment}{ * run the operator control task. Be warned that this will also occur if the VEX Cortex is}
00027 \textcolor{comment}{ * tethered directly to a computer via the USB A to A cable without any VEX Joystick attached.}
00028 \textcolor{comment}{ *}
00029 \textcolor{comment}{ * Code running in this task can take almost any action, as the VEX Joystick is available and}
00030 \textcolor{comment}{ * the scheduler is operational. However, proper use of delay() or taskDelayUntil() is highly}
00031 \textcolor{comment}{ * recommended to give other tasks (including system tasks such as updating LCDs) time to run.}

00033 \textcolor{comment}{ * This task should never exit; it should end with some kind of infinite loop, even if empty.}
